# Virtual Stoics
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism">Stoicism</a> is a school of Hellenistic philosophy that flourished throughout the Roman and Greek world until the 3rd century AD. Stoicism is predominantly a philosophy of personal ethics which is informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural world. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to happiness for humans is found in accepting this moment as it presents itself, by not allowing ourselves to be controlled by our desire for pleasure or our fear of pain, by using our minds to understand the world around us and to do our part in nature's plan, and by working together and treating others in a fair and just manner. 

There has been a resurgence of this school of thought. Communities are flourishing, there are books being published regularly, and people are always looking for more resources that will help them with their practice. Thus, the VirtualStoics organization was created. The goal of this community is to create software which will be useful for the people that are interested in such resources, and to have fun while creating it!
